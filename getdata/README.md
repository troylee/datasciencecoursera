============

This is the repo for the course project of the Coursera[https://www.coursera.org/] course Getting and Cleaning Data.

The main script is **run_analysis.R**. It requires the existence of the UCI HAR dataset at the same location. 

The script will load in both the training and testing data from the dataset, clean up the data and generate a new tidy data set in the **tidy_data.csv** file. 

Detailed processing steps, please refer to the **CodeBook.md** file.
